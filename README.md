### Hi there, I'm Vathsan ðŸ‘‹

I am a bright and highly-motivated person who loves solving problems and working towards team goals. I harnessed my skills for problem-solving, debugging, teamwork, and analytical thinking as a Senior Software Engineer at WSO2, the world's #1 open-source integration vendor.

Now I am working on my graduate studies at University of Alberta, focusing on using these skills to build deep learning algorithms that align with my values. Be that harnessing human potential through accessible applications, advancing connected devices technology, or protecting our environment.

I am confident working with Java, Python, SQL, SOAP, REST, HTML, and CSS. Iâ€™ve also worked with Go and C++. 

### Highlights of Skills

- 3 years of experience in developing and supporting enterprise-level integration solutions hosted on Cloud and On-premise technologies
- Worked on multiple customer engagements to fulfill their requirements using the WSO2 product stack
- Ability to effectively analyze logs, thread dumps, heap dumps and tcp dumps to debug issues
- Hands on experience building CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy code changes to hybrid cloud (AWS EKS)
- Hands on experience training CNNs, to classify land scenes and supervised models to predict home values 
- Experience in handling big data, from data cleaning to making prediction models 
- Applied best software engineering practices and contributed to develop products, especially in the aspects of distributed computing, enterprise integration, API management and microservices
